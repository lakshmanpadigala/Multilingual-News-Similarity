Task Description.


Data Crawling:

We implemented 2 baseline approaches:
1)


2) We implemented a Siamese Architecture inspired by [1] to predict the news similarity scores.
    dataPrepare.py takes the crawled data and puts it in one json (list of dict)
    MLNS_Siamese_roberta.ipynb implements the model to get predictions.
        We used xlm-roberta-base for tokenization and modeling.
